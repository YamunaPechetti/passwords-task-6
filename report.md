# Password Strength Report

## Summary

I created three types of passwords (simple, moderate, and complex), and tested them using `passwordmeter.com`. The results showed:

- **Simple passwords** like `password123` and `qwertyuiop` are highly vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.
- **Moderate passwords** like `P@ssw0rd2025` are better but still guessable.
- **Complex passwords** like `%Tg!eY#9k@8LpV$3` scored 100% and are far more secure.

## Tips for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12â€“16 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols
- Avoid common words or patterns
- Use passphrases for better memorability
- Never reuse passwords across sites

## Common Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries words from a dictionary or leaked password lists

## Importance of MFA
Using **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds an extra layer of security even if a password is compromised.

## Role of Password Managers
Password managers can store and generate complex passwords securely, reducing the need to remember each one.
